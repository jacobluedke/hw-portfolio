#This is my first attempt at a Portfolio.

I included my first homework as my top webpage and used placeholders for everything else.

As I create more websites outside of class I will also create other portfolios to practice making it look more professional and function the way that it is supposed to.

I will also continue practicing how to orgainize elements so when the size of the screen changes, everthing is layed out the correct way.


## Update to the portfolio

I added our first project to the portfolio, and as I continue creating projects and webpages I will continue adding them.

I didn't have access to our projects pages link so I didn't link that to the image. For now it brings you to the github repo, and once I have access to the pages link I will add that instead.
